# css-sharpspring-widget
A tool for integrating SharpSpring with circle S studio's WordPress website by generating a copyable PHP snippet that can be added to functions.php. When using the custom form option, this tool also allows you to integrate SharpSpring with any Gravity Form on any website.

## Project Summary
SharpSpring, a leading marketing automation and CRM platform, was recently acquired by Constant Contact, who quickly began migrating content and documentation from the old platform’s pages to a new location on their own servers (acquisition in 2021, rebranding and documentation transfer in late 2023).

As a part of this content migration, Constant Contact broke the pages and tools my agency was using to integrate our WordPress website with SharpSpring’s CRM platform through Gravity Forms.

In particular, the old documentation included a several-step process for generating a custom PHP snippet that you could paste into your site’s functions.php file to allow Gravity Form submissions to send information to SharpSpring’s servers, allowing you to update SharpSpring records automatically from form submissions on your website.

This loss in documentation and the resulting breaking of the tools we were using meant that it became much more complicated to create the custom PHP snippets we needed to continue integrating forms on our website.

For this reason, I built a small widget in Javascript, hosted on GitHub pages, to provide the same functionality and fill this gap in technology.
